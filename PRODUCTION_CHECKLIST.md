- [ ] Rate limiting enabled and configured appropriately
- [ ] CORS origins restricted to your domains only
- [ ] HTTPS enforced in production
- [ ] Security headers enabled via Helmet
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization in place
- [ ] Session timeout configured appropriately

## Performance

- [ ] Production NODE_ENV set
- [ ] Request logging configured (not too verbose for production)
- [ ] Session cleanup mechanism running
- [ ] Appropriate request size limits set
- [ ] Efficient error handling (no sensitive info leakage)

## Monitoring

- [ ] Health check endpoint available
- [ ] Error logging configured
- [ ] Performance monitoring set up
- [ ] Rate limit monitoring in place

## Infrastructure

- [ ] Database/Redis for session storage (if multi-instance)
- [ ] Load balancer configuration (if applicable)
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates configured
- [ ] Backup and recovery plan
- [ ] Auto-scaling configuration

## Testing

- [ ] API endpoints tested with valid credentials
- [ ] Rate limiting tested
- [ ] Error scenarios tested
- [ ] Session management tested
- [ ] Load testing completed

## Documentation

- [ ] API documentation up to date
- [ ] Environment setup documented
- [ ] Deployment process documented
- [ ] Error codes documented

## Before Going Live

1. Test all endpoints with real Otter.ai credentials
2. Verify rate limits don't interfere with normal usage
3. Test session timeout behavior
4. Verify CORS settings work with your frontend
5. Test error handling in all scenarios
6. Monitor logs for any issues
7. Set up alerting for critical errors

## Post-Deployment

1. Monitor API response times
2. Check error rates
3. Verify session cleanup is working
4. Monitor rate limit usage
5. Check for any security issues
6. Monitor Otter.ai API usage against their limits
